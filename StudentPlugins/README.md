Holds the project structure for each group to be compiled. When a group uploads their code to the React webserver, it will be placed in their group's folder and compiled through Maven.

Note:

- You may have to change the Spigot API version in the pom.xml file to the latest version.
- You may also have to change the commands under plugin.yml to accomodate for the respective level.
- If you have more than 8 groups, you will need to create group folders for each group
