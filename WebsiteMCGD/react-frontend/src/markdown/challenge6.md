**Description**: Defeat as many monsters as possible before the timer runs out! You have until 4:30pm (EST) to achieve the highest monster kill count out of all student groups.

**Constraints**:

* You cannot directly call remove/set the health of any entity. Otherwise, go wild!

* Note that the arena is malleable. AKA: aside from the floor, it will explode if you try to blow it up. Careful!

* **Remember that the servers only have so many resources and RAM! If your server is overloaded and it crashes, you cannot win.**
