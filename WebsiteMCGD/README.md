api - NodeJS backend

You need to edit the api/scripts/updatepluginfiles.sh file to transfer the succeeded plugin jar file to the respective group server. Look at: line under "VERIFICATION SUCCESS"

react-frontend - self explanatory

Note that both the api and react-frontend were written as a method to learn the two platforms; thus, the code is probably pretty messy, but it is possible to use it as-is without any changes!
